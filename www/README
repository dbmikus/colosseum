Note about file names:
  All desktop file names are prefixed with "desktop-"

  All mobile file names except index.html are prefixed with "mobile-"
  The main page for mobile must be named index.html since that is the file that
  PhoneGap looks for.

  Besides the index.html file, if a file has no "desktop-" or "mobile-" prefix,
  then it is multi-platform and system independent.
