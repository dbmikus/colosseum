				Collosseum is a place for people to come together and compete. Users
				can create and join arenas where they battle head to head in any 
				competition you can imagine utilizing their mouse, their webcam, 
				their microphone, their keyboard, and any skills they bring to 
				the table. Spectators vote on who they want to see continue, and the
				loser is thrown to the lions, only to be replaced by a random spectator!
				</div>
			<div class ="brick"><b> How can I play? </b> <br><br>
				Using the buttons at the top of your page, you can navigate to the list
				of Arenas where you can immediately start spectating and making your voice
				heard by voting. Or, if you want to jump right in, you can create your own
				Arena and start out at the center of all of the fun. Good luck!
