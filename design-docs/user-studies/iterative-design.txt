== Changes based on user studies ==

Splash screen describing the application and illustrating its uses. Will also
include a link to browse and spectate rooms and a link to register.

Tutorial and prompts about how to interact with the application. Informative
text to prompt users and tell them what is going on. We want the application
to guide the user through the steps to create a room and instruct them on how to
compete and spectate/vote in a room.

Data vizualization of voting over time. Users wanted to see a visual response to
their actions.

Changing color scheme to fit competitive theme of the application.

Some testers were interested in having some kind of persistent avatar for their
account. People like a consistent presence and a sense of identity. We won't
require that people actually identify their real-life selves, though.

We need to make the transitions between game states very recognizable. Examples
of game state changes are when a competitor loses and swaps places with a
spectator. There should be animations for winners and losers, highlighting that
a user has moved from the competitor section to the spectator section, or
highlighting that the user has remained a competitor.

Emphasize the avatars and personas for those competing. People like to form a
connection with who they are spectating, so it is important for spectators to be
able to instantly recognize who is competing.

Have a game type that switches between different games (text chat game,
sandboxed games, etc.).
