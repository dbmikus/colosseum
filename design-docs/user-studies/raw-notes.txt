Question about persistent rooms.

Verification system / login. Can users spectate and chat without registering?
How do you prevent users from spoofing being a competitor?
(we actually ensure this doesn't happen)

Should competitiors also be able to chat with spectators in the spectator
channel?

Navigation back to rooms with back button

Archiving rooms

Debate application sounds like a cool feature. Emphasize that feature.

Need instructions for games and what the rules of games are.
Needs a description of the use purpose of the app.

Ability to control who plays in the games. Currently, the 3rd and 4th person to
join are the competitors and then someone from the spectators gets subbed into
the competition when someone loses.

Better indication for who is the competitor.

Need to implement user login and registration, which is a planned feature.
