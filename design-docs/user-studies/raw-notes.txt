== Notes From User Tests ==

Question about persistent rooms.

Verification system / login. Can users spectate and chat without registering?
How do you prevent users from spoofing being a competitor?
(we actually ensure this doesn't happen)

Should competitiors also be able to chat with spectators in the spectator
channel?

Navigation back to rooms with back button

Archiving rooms

Debate application sounds like a cool feature. Emphasize that feature.

Need instructions for games and what the rules of games are.
Needs a description of the use purpose of the app.

Ability to control who plays in the games. Currently, the 3rd and 4th person to
join are the competitors and then someone from the spectators gets subbed into
the competition when someone loses.

Better indication for who is the competitor.

Need to implement user login and registration, which is a planned feature.


== Observations and Conclusions ==

Our product was quite unpolished when we hit user testing, so there was a lot of
confusion over the purpose of the application and how to use it. I think that an
important thing for us to work on is a description of what the site is and how
to use it. If those two things are understood, you will not be able to get any
users. After that, we need a clear interface that responds to user interaction
indicating what the user has done and what their status is on the website and in
an arena. For example, users could not easily tell when they were competitors or
spectators, and users also wanted to be able to login to create accounts.
Accounts have already been a planned feature, but people seemed to place more
emphasis on them, so we might add features so that a user profile can become
more of an identiy (include profile pictures, user statistics, etc.).

Once people understood the idea, they liked it. We are basically creating a
platform for competition and spectation, so there could be a lot of options for
how users can use the application. We just need to express a convincing reason
to use the application and also instructions that make it easy to set up arenas
and to spectate them.

People also wanted to see more user statistics about voting, potentially with a
graph of how votes have changed. This kind of stuff falls under visual user
feedback, which expresses information while letting the user know that the
system has registered their actions.

User 1

more pompting for users (create your arena)
just chatroom options
room filters
voting feedback (poll results)
room host should have power (notifications and room rules)


User 2

tutorial (make the story clearer)
more messages for the user
give the user an image of what they are using (story boardish)
Rounded corners
subtlepatterns.com
"tactile" feedback


== Observations and Conclusions ==

A key point of our app is user participation, and without clear instructions,
even users who want to participate cannot. Nearly all of the users we tested
with could use the basic functionality (the chat room), but felt lost as to what
was going on. So, to make sure the user is able to participate and enjoy it, we
need a splash screen that states the goal, and hints on the page that prompt the
user to complete basic tasks and learn the basics of using the app.

We plan on spending a considerable amount of time on the layout of our splash
screen because of how vital it is to getting the user experience off the ground.
For example, Facebook and Twitter's splash screens explain shortly what the app
is for conceptually, and allows the user to register and get started. Both have
subsequent tutorials, which we plan on making as well, based on further user
testing. The steps covered in the basic tutorial will have to be fleshed out
over an additional series of user tests. (dat iterative design doe)

Also, some users stated that they felt as if their vote was not being counted.
This can easily be solved by displaying a confirmation that the user's vote was
received or a simple graph that represents the data collected from all users.
In a live setting this could be as simple as a bar graph showing the totals for
each competitor, but demographic data could also be collected to allow for more
detailed analysis of statistics.

more notification of what is currently going on

we had several different types of fonts on different pages, and some on the same
pages. we need to just pick a font.

button affordance on voting buttons

the view of the arena page is too tall. It shouldn't need vertical scrolling on
any modern browser.

all components should have some sort of title. It makes it easier to understand
what should be the focus of attention.

user names should be used in both the chatroom and the game itself to prevent
confusion about who is who.

we had a few suggestions about how to do a phone layout, which they drew.
Generally the idea was to try to be minimal, and only have the chat and keyboard
be visible when the user wants to say something.

many buttons and divs were not aligned in the best possible way.

The biggest complaint was that it was hard to understand what was going on at
any given time. Their are several different phases of the game, and our users
didn't have a good idea of what stage they were on at each time.

Lastly they also had a good idea about randomizing game type. So you could join
a room and would switch between a chat battle, a drawing battle, a webcam
battle, and whatever else we can come up with with our API.


== Observations and Conclusions ==

Several of the users that we tested with were design oriented people, which was
a great coincidence for us since we have little to no design experience. Right
off the bat there were several reasonably simple things that we just missed.
These don't really need explanation so I will just list them:

- Our fonts were not standard across the entire website. This was the result of
  using IFrames that used different CSS files.

- Inside of an arena, the view is too tall, and requires vertical scrolling.

- Games should use the username of the different players to identify them rather
  than anonymously call them player 1 and player 2.

- Some buttons and elements were not correctly aligned.

- The voting buttons had bad affordance. It was hard to tell which one was the
  selected one since there were only two.

Beyond that we had a few more broad suggestions.

My users' biggest problem was understanding what they were supposed to be doing.
We had very little information telling them how to interact with the app.
